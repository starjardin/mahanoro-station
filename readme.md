# Mahanoro Station
# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station

![Design preview for the Mahanoro station coding challenge](./design/1.png)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this app and get it working with **redux**, **compound components** and **styled components**, while making it look as close to the design as possible.

This is a website that will allow us to reserve some seats in _"Taxi brousses"_ departing from Mahanoro station.

Your users should be able to:

- Pick a city from the city list
- See the available trips to that city, and pick one where seats are still availalable
- Select one or more seats in the car, and see how much it's going to cost
- Confirm the booking
- See their confirmed bookings on the 'My account'page
- Modify their own information, like name or phone number, on that same page.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs from this Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/6gSAJpaedebKAUuaM4ekFR/Mahanoro-Station?node-id=4%3A38

The data from the trips are available on this link : https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/36bb5fbf9b6a686f0baf4006dd137bca/raw/a40d8b3f696a75f388db286d57bdd05a925fa0e7/trips.json

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

-   You can see my demo in the following link 
    <a href="https://tanteli-mahanoro-station.netlify.app/">
      Work Demo
    </a>. The project was fun to play with, I loved it. Although it is not perfect.

-   This project was fun to play with. It's a big one but I liked it. Some of the features are not accomplished, however, some are ok. To be direct the app is not fully completed. The cancel button is still not working properly.

-  If I had more time, I would fix the cancel buttons, I can only cancel one city and after that i won't work, and also when I update the bookings it should lead me to the seats page, wheras it stays on the account page, so I definetely would improve that issue.

-   My experience was, when I was working on a big statement, I needed to break it down into as small as possible parts, I found that detailing is really hard. It is much easier to handle it little by little. One tip that I found is really helpful also figuring out what the app does in general, it is very important before you dive into coding because from that, you know what you are going to tackle.

-   The most challenging part was, breaking down the statement, plannig and data structuring. I found they are the fundamental piece to start the project. Apart from that, updating nested and and objects are still a bit blury but I think that will be just fine in the long run.

-   One thing I think is a wisdom that I would like to share is : it is very crucial to have a general idea about what the app is doing and start to break big problems to smaller once before diving into coding. No matter how tough it is, break the big problems down into as small parts as possible before tackling them. If you have a good base the likelyhood of having a good end is very heigh. One thing that I always forget and I think is a good idea is to comment code. I need to start practicing that.
