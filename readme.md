# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station

![Design preview for the Mahanoro station coding challenge](./design/1.png)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this app and get it working with **redux**, **compound components** and **styled components**, while making it look as close to the design as possible.

This is a website that will allow us to reserve some seats in _"Taxi brousses"_ departing from Mahanoro station.

Your users should be able to:

- Pick a city from the city list
- See the available trips to that city, and pick one where seats are still availalable
- Select one or more seats in the car, and see how much it's going to cost
- Confirm the booking
- See their confirmed bookings on the 'My account'page
- Modify their own information, like name or phone number, on that same page.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs from this Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/6gSAJpaedebKAUuaM4ekFR/Mahanoro-Station?node-id=4%3A38

The data from the trips are available on this link : https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Pinois/36bb5fbf9b6a686f0baf4006dd137bca/raw/a40d8b3f696a75f388db286d57bdd05a925fa0e7/trips.json

<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

-   You can see my demo in the following link 
    <a href="https://tanteli-mahanoro-station.netlify.app/">
      Work Demo
    </a>. The project was fun to play with, I loved it. Although it is not perfect.

-   My experience was when I was working out a big statement, I needed to break it down into as small as possible parts. It is much easier to handle it little by little. Figuring out what the app does is very important before you dive into coding.

-   

-   One thing I think is a wisdom that I would like to share is : it is very crucial to have a general idea about what the app is doing and start to break big problems to smaller once before diving into coding. No matter how tough it is, break the big problems down into as small parts as possible before tackling them. If you have a good base the likelyhood of having a good end is very heigh.
